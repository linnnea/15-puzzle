# 15 Puzzle Game

This project is a fun and interactive implementation of the classic 15 puzzle game, built using Next.js, TypeScript, react-spring/web, and styled-components.

## Getting Started

To get started with the game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run either `yarn install` or `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Run either `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` to start the development server.
5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to play the game.

## How to Play

The objective of the 15 Puzzle Game is to rearrange the tiles in numerical order from 1 to either 9 or 15 depending on game level, with the empty tile in the bottom right corner. You can move tiles by clicking or tapping on them if they are adjacent to the empty space. Keep rearranging until you solve the puzzle!

### Difficulty Levels

You can choose to play the game in either easy or hard mode:

- **Easy Mode**: Start with the tiles arranged in numerical order. Perfect for beginners or a quick challenge!
- **Hard Mode**: Begin with the tiles shuffled randomly. Can you solve the puzzle from this scrambled state?

## Features

- Built with Next.js, providing a fast and efficient development environment.
- Utilizes TypeScript for enhanced code readability and maintainability.
- Smooth animations powered by react-spring/web.
- Stylish and customizable UI components using styled-components.
